# PaymentsController Overview





## deductBalance Optimizations

The `deductBalance` function is the most frequently called function in the PaymentsController, executed on every credential verification. 
Given its high usage, we've implemented a hybrid storage-memory optimization pattern that reduces gas consumption by approximately 40% while maintaining code clarity and security.

**The Hybrid Approach**
We employ a dual-reference pattern that optimizes for both read and write operations:

```solidity
// Storage pointer for write operations
DataTypes.Schema storage schemaStorage = _schemas[schemaId];

// Memory copy for read operations  
DataTypes.Schema memory schema = schemaStorage;
```

**This pattern allows us to:**

1. Read efficiently: Access struct fields from memory (3 gas) instead of storage (100 gas)
2. Write selectively: Update storage only when necessary using the storage pointer
3. Maintain consistency: Keep a clear separation between read and write operations

### Design Rationale

**Why Hybrid Instead of Pure Memory?**
- Conditional Updates: Fee updates only occur when conditions are met
- Atomic Operations: Storage updates must be atomic for consistency
- Memory Limitations: Full memory copy would be wasteful for conditional writes

**Why Not Pure Storage?**
- Read Frequency: Schema fields are read 8-10 times per execution
- Calculation Needs: Multiple fields needed for fee calculations
- Cost Multiplication: Each storage read adds 100 gas

### Gas Savings Breakdown

| **Optimization Technique**| **Gas Saved**  | **Impact**                              |
|---------------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Schema memory caching     | ~800 gas       | Eliminates 8 storage reads              |
| Verifier data caching     | ~200 gas       | Eliminates 2 storage reads              |
| Batch storage updates     | ~100 gas       | Reduces storage operation overhead      |
| Unchecked arithmetic      | ~80 gas        | Safe counters don't need overflow checks|
| **Total Savings**         | **~1,180 gas** | **~40% reduction**                      |



## deductBalanceZeroFee 

`deductBalanceZeroFee` exists as a distinct function to handle credential verifications where the schema fee is set to zero. 

This separation is intentional for several reasons, but primarily for gas optimization, since we do not expect zero-fee verifications be to be common:

- **Gas Optimization:** By omitting fee-related logic and storage updates, the function minimizes execution cost for free credentials.
- **Signature Simplicity:** Zero-fee verifications do not require the `amount` parameter in the EIP-712 signature, reducing signature complexity and potential for mismatches.
- **Security and Clarity:** Isolating zero-fee logic prevents accidental fee deductions and clarifies intent, reducing the risk of subtle bugs or exploits.
- **Auditability:** Having a dedicated code path for zero-fee operations makes it easier to review, test, and reason about the contractâ€™s behavior in these scenarios.

***TLDR:*** 
- Chose to not add a zero-fee branch in `deductBalance` for a low-frequency event. This streamlines `deductBalance`, while allowing of exceptions.*
- Zero-fee path creates unnecessary branching in the original with a large gas footprint
