# IssuerStakingController Overview

IssuerStakingController.sol lets issuers stake MOCA tokens, with a required delay to unstake. Security is built in with limits, pausing, freezing, and emergency exit features. Only certain roles can take admin actions. 

Off-chain systems check staked balances of issuers to enforce limits on their credential issuances. This is handled within the SDK.

# 1. **Contract Overview**

## Staking Mechanism

Issuers can stake MOCA tokens directly to the contract, with immediate effect on their staked balance and the global totals.

```solidity
mapping(address issuer => uint256 mocaStaked) public issuers;
```

- **Address-based**: Each issuer address maintains its own staked balance
- **Immediate effect**: Staking takes effect immediately upon transaction confirmation
- **No minimum requirements**: Any amount > 0 and ≤ `MAX_STAKE_AMOUNT` can be staked
- **Cumulative**: Multiple stakes add to existing balance

## Unstaking Process

```solidity
mapping(address issuer => mapping(uint256 timestamp => uint256 pendingUnstake)) public pendingUnstakedMoca;
mapping(address issuer => uint256 totalPendingUnstake) public totalPendingUnstakedMoca;
```

**Two-Phase Process:**
1. **Initiate**: Move tokens from active staked to pending unstake
2. **Claim**: Transfer tokens to issuer after delay period

When tokens are moved to pending unstake, they are decremented in issuers mapping. This reflects that these tokens are no longer actively staked. 

**Timing Mechanism:**
- Unstaking delay is configurable by contract admin.
- Each unstake initiation creates a timestamp-based claimable entry
- Multiple unstakes can be claimed in a single transaction

## Global State Tracking

The contract maintains comprehensive global state for protocol-wide visibility:

```solidity
uint256 public TOTAL_MOCA_STAKED;            // Active staked tokens
uint256 public TOTAL_MOCA_PENDING_UNSTAKE;   // Tokens awaiting claim
uint256 public UNSTAKE_DELAY;               // Delay period for unstaking
uint256 public MAX_STAKE_AMOUNT;            // Maximum single stake amount
```

**State Consistency:**
- Global totals are updated atomically with individual issuer balances
- Pending unstake amounts are tracked separately from active stakes
- All state changes emit events for comprehensive audit trails

---

# 2. **Design Choices**

## Time-Delayed Unstaking

The unstaking delay serves multiple security purposes:

**Rationale:**
- **Slashing Protection**: Prevents immediate withdrawal during disputes
- **Economic Stability**: Reduces volatility from rapid stake changes

**Implementation:**
- Delay period is set at deployment and can be updated by admin
- Each unstake initiation calculates claimable timestamp: `block.timestamp + UNSTAKE_DELAY`
- Tokens remain in contract during delay period

## Maximum Stake Limits

The `MAX_STAKE_AMOUNT` parameter prevents excessive single transactions:

**Rationale:**
- **Fat-finger Protection**: Prevents accidental large stakes
- **Risk Management**: Limits exposure from single transaction errors

**Flexibility:**
- Can be updated by admin as protocol matures
- Applies per transaction, not cumulative balance
- Issuers can stake multiple times up to the limit; but this would be an intentional choice on their part.

# 3. **Contract Functions Walkthrough**

## `stakeMoca()`

The primary staking function enables issuers to stake MOCA tokens:

```solidity
function stakeMoca(uint256 amount) external whenNotPaused
```

**Process Flow:**
1. **Validation**: Checks amount > 0 and ≤ MAX_STAKE_AMOUNT
2. **State Updates**: Increments issuer balance and global totals
3. **Token Transfer**: Transfers MOCA from issuer to contract
4. **Event Emission**: Records staking event for audit trail


## `initiateUnstake()`

Initiates the unstaking process, moving tokens to pending state:

```solidity
function initiateUnstake(uint256 amount) external whenNotPaused
```

**Process Flow:**
1. **Validation**: Checks amount > 0 and ≤ issuer's staked balance
2. **Timestamp Calculation**: Determines claimable timestamp
3. **State Updates**: 
   - Decrements active staked balance
   - Increments pending unstake amount
   - Updates global totals
   - Updates `totalPendingUnstakedMoca` mapping
4. **Event Emission**: Records unstake initiation with timestamp

Each unstake gets unique claimable time; multiple unstakes at different times, create separate timestamps.

## `claimUnstake()`

Claims unstaked tokens after the delay period:

```solidity
function claimUnstake(uint256[] calldata timestamps) external whenNotPaused
```

**Process Flow:**
1. **Early Validation**: Checks array length and `totalPendingUnstakedMoca` > 0
2. **Timestamp Validation**: Verifies delay period has passed for each timestamp
3. **Amount Calculation**: Sums all claimable amounts
4. **State Cleanup**: Deletes pending entries and updates totals
5. **Token Transfer**: Transfers MOCA to issuer
6. **Event Emission**: Records claim event

**Batch Processing:**
- **Efficiency**: Claim multiple unstakes in single transaction 
- **Gas Savings**: Reduces transaction overhead
- **User Experience**: Simplified claiming process

## Admin Functions

### Parameter Management

**`setUnstakeDelay()`**: Updates the unstaking delay period
- Only callable by IssuerStakingController admin
- Affects future unstake initiations only
- Emits event with old and new values

**`setMaxStakeAmount()`**: Updates maximum stake limit
- Only callable by IssuerStakingController admin
- Affects future stake transactions only
- Emits event with old and new values

# 4. **Execution Flows**

## Typical Staking Flow

1. **Issuer Decision**: Issuer decides to stake MOCA tokens
2. **Approval**: Issuer approves MOCA transfer to `IssuerStakingController`
3. **Stake Transaction**: Issuer calls `stakeMoca(amount)`
4. **Contract Processing**:
   - Validates amount and limits
   - Updates issuer balance and global totals
   - Transfers MOCA tokens
   - Emits staking event
5. **Confirmation**: Staking complete, tokens locked in contract

## Unstaking and Claiming Flow

1. **Unstake Initiation**: Issuer calls `initiateUnstake(amount)`
2. **Contract Processing**:
   - Validates amount against staked balance
   - Calculates claimable timestamp
   - Moves tokens to pending state
   - Updates both timestamp-specific and total pending mappings
   - Emits unstake initiation event
3. **Waiting Period**: Tokens remain locked for `UNSTAKE_DELAY`
4. **Claim Preparation**: Issuer identifies claimable timestamps
5. **Claim Transaction**: Issuer calls `claimUnstake(timestamps[])`
6. **Contract Processing**:
   - Early validation using `totalPendingUnstakedMoca`
   - Validates timestamps and amounts
   - Transfers MOCA tokens to issuer
   - Cleans up pending entries and updates totals
   - Emits claim event

# 5. **Integration Points**

## With AddressBook
- **Token Address Resolution**: Reads MOCA token address dynamically
- **Upgrade Support**: Enables seamless contract upgrades
- **Treasury Access**: Emergency exit transfers to treasury address

## With AccessController
- **Role-based Access**: Enforces admin permissions
- **Risk Management**: Integrates with pause/unpause mechanisms
- **Emergency Procedures**: Coordinates with emergency exit handlers

*Note that there is no direct integration with PaymentsController.sol. Though one might consider it sensible to do so, so that issuerAsset addressess can be consistently tracked and logged protocol-wide. We choose to leave this for a v2 implementation; should it be considered necessary.*

# 6. **Risk Management**

## Access Control Hierarchy

### Operational Roles
- **IssuerStakingController Admin**: Configure parameters and limits
- **Monitor**: Pause contract in emergencies
- **Global Admin**: Unpause and freeze operations
- **Emergency Exit Handler**: Recover funds when frozen

### Security Features

1. **Pausable Operations**
   - All state-changing functions check pause status
   - Monitor can pause, only Global Admin can unpause
   - Prevents damage during active incidents

2. **Freeze Mechanism**
   - One-way operation requiring contract to be paused first
   - Enables emergency exit procedures
   - Cannot be reversed - kill-switch

3. **Parameter Limits**
   - Maximum stake amounts prevent excessive transactions
   - Configurable unstaking delays provide security buffer
   - Admin controls maintain operational flexibility

---

# 7. **Emergency Procedures**

## Emergency Exit Process

The `emergencyExit()` function provides a targeted recovery mechanism:

```solidity
function emergencyExit(address[] calldata issuerAddresses) external onlyEmergencyExitHandler
```

**Prerequisites:**
- Contract must be frozen (`isFrozen == 1`)
- Only callable by Emergency Exit Handler role
- Must provide non-empty array of issuer addresses

**Process:**
1. **Validation**: Confirms frozen state and non-empty address array
2. **Batch Processing**: Iterates through each issuer address
3. **Amount Calculation**: Sums staked and pending MOCA per issuer
4. **Token Transfer**: Transfers MOCA directly to each issuer
5. **State Cleanup**: Resets issuer balances and updates global totals
6. **Event Emission**: Records emergency exit with processed addresses and total MOCA

**Key Improvements:**
- **Targeted Recovery**: Processes specific issuers instead of transferring everything to treasury or otherwise
- **Direct User Access**: Users receive their MOCA directly, not through treasury
- **Batch Efficiency**: Handles multiple issuers in single transaction
- **Selective Processing**: Skips issuers with zero balances automatically

**Recovery Implications:**
- **User Impact**: Affected issuers receive their MOCA directly
- **State Reset**: Processed issuer balances reset to zero
- **Irreversible**: Cannot be undone once executed

## Emergency Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Critical Bug Discovery / Contract Compromise
1. Monitor calls `pause()` - stops all operations
2. Team investigates and determines response or fix timeline
3. If fixable: Deploy fix, `unpause()` when safe
4. If critical: `freeze()` and initiate emergency exit for affected issuers

### Scenario 2: Malicious Admin [Parameter Manipulation]
1. Cannot steal funds (only configure parameters)
2. Can manipulate limits: Admin sets extreme parameters (very long delays, very low limits)
3. Users affected by parameter changes
4. Remove Malicious admin through AccessController.
4. Worst case: Emergency exit recovers funds for specific issuers

### Scenario 3: Contract Upgrade Failure
1. Old contract continues operating normally
2. If new contract has issues: revert AddressBook update
3. If migration fails: emergency exit for affected issuers
4. User funds always recoverable through emergency procedures

### Others: Integration With Risk Management
- Pause mechanisms coordinate with other protocol contracts
- Freeze procedures provide system-wide emergency response
- Emergency exit ensures user fund recovery across all scenarios

# 8. **Upgrade Architecture**

## Upgrade Process

1. **Deploy** new IssuerStakingController version
2. **Configure** new contract with existing parameters
3. **Update** AddressBook to point to new contract
4. **Notify** issuers to migrate stakes (unstake → re-stake)
5. **Freeze** old contract once migration complete

## Design for Upgradeability

- **No Direct Dependencies**: Only integrates through AddressBook
- **Clean Interfaces**: Simple staking/unstaking operations
- **State Isolation**: Each issuer's stake is independent
- **Emergency Recovery**: Ensures no funds locked during transition
