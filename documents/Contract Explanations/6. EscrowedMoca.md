# EscrowedMoca (esMoca)

EscrowedMoca provides a flexible, secure mechanism for distributing protocol rewards while incentivizing long-term alignment. 

Through its redemption system, it balances immediate liquidity needs with value accrual for patient participants, creating a sustainable token economy that benefits all stakeholders.


## Overview

EscrowedMoca (esMoca) is a non-transferable token representing Moca tokens held in escrow within the protocol ecosystem. 
- functions as a reward token that can be redeemed for Moca through various redemption options
- each redemption option has different lock periods and conversion rates
- similar to early bond redemption mechanisms with penalties for immediate liquidity.

### **Key Features:**
- 1:1 conversion from MOCA to esMoca (no penalty on entry)
- Multiple redemption pathways with configurable lock periods and conversion rates
- Penalty system that redistributes value to voters and treasury
- Non-transferable by default (except for whitelisted addresses)
- Integrated risk management with pause and freeze mechanisms

### **Objective of esMoca**

1. **Incentivize long-term holding** - Users who wait longer receive full value
2. **Provide liquidity options** - Users can exit early at a penalty
3. **Redistribute value** - Penalties from early redemptions benefit other ecosystem participants

### The Escrow-Redemption Lifecycle

Native Moca → esMoca (1:1, no penalty) → Choose Redemption Option → Receive Native Moca or wMoca (with/without penalty)

## Redemption System

### Redemption Options

The contract supports multiple redemption options, each defined by:
- **Lock Duration**: How long tokens are locked before redemption (0 for instant)
- **Receivable Percentage**: What percentage of esMoca converts to MOCA (up to 100%)
- **Enabled Status**: Whether the option is currently available

Example redemption options:
```
Option 0: Standard   - 180 days lock, 100% receivable (no penalty)
Option 1: Early      - 30 days lock,  80% receivable (20% penalty)  
Option 2: Instant    - 0 days lock,   50% receivable (50% penalty)
```

### How Redemption Works

1. **Selection Phase** (`selectRedemptionOption`)
   - User chooses a redemption option and `amount`
   - `esMoca` is immediately burned
   - Redemption is scheduled based on lock duration
   - If instant (0 lock), native `Moca` is transferred immediately (wraps to wMoca if transfer fails within gas limit)
   - If locked, user must wait and claim later
   - Pending redemptions are tracked in `TOTAL_MOCA_PENDING_REDEMPTION`

2. **Claim Phase** (`claimRedemptions`)
   - After lock period expires, user claims their Moca by providing an array of redemption timestamps
   - Can claim multiple redemptions in a single transaction
   - Native `Moca` is transferred (wraps to wMoca if transfer fails within gas limit)
   - No additional penalties at claim time

### Penalty Mechanics

When users redeem with a penalty:
- The penalty amount is the difference between `esMoca` burned and `moca` received
- Penalties are split between:
  - **Voters**: Percentage defined by `VOTERS_PENALTY_PCT` (can be 0, meaning all penalties go to treasury)
  - **Treasury**: Remaining percentage (100% if `VOTERS_PENALTY_PCT` is 0)

This creates a value redistribution mechanism where early exits benefit long-term participants.

**Important Design Choice**: 
```solidity
// We block redemptions where penalty rounds to 0 but receivable > 0
require(penaltyAmount > 0, Errors.InvalidAmount());
```
This prevents gaming the system with micro-transactions that would avoid penalties due to rounding.

## Key Functions

### For Users

**`escrowMoca()`**
- Converts native MOCA (sent via `msg.value`) to esMoca at 1:1 ratio
- No approval needed (native Moca transfer)
- Mints esMoca to caller

**`selectRedemptionOption(uint256 redemptionOption, uint256 redemptionAmount)`**
- Initiates redemption process
- Burns esMoca immediately
- Schedules or executes redemption based on lock duration
- Transfers native Moca (or wMoca if native transfer fails within gas limit); for instant redemptions
- Updates `TOTAL_MOCA_PENDING_REDEMPTION` for locked redemptions

**`claimRedemptions(uint256[] calldata redemptionTimestamps)`**
- Claims MOCA after lock period expires for multiple redemptions in one call
- Accepts array of redemption timestamps to claim
- Transfers native Moca (or wMoca if native transfer fails within gas limit)
- Only for non-instant redemptions

### A note on `TOTAL_MOCA_PENDING_REDEMPTION`:

`TOTAL_MOCA_PENDING_REDEMPTION` tracks MOCA that has been redeemed but not yet claimed.
- Incremented when a redemption is scheduled (non-instant redemptions)
- Decremented when redemptions are claimed
- Represents locked MOCA awaiting claim by users

### For CronJob

**`escrowMocaOnBehalf(address[] calldata users, uint256[] calldata amounts)`**
- Batch mint esMoca to multiple users
- Accepts native Moca via `msg.value` (must equal sum of amounts)
- Used for protocol rewards distribution (called bi-weekly)
- Only callable by CronJob role

### For Asset Managers

**`claimPenalties()`**
- Withdraws accumulated penalties for voters/treasury
- Transfers to esMoca treasury address (from AccessController)
- Tracks claimed vs unclaimed amounts
- Transfers native Moca (or wMoca if native transfer fails within gas limit)

**`releaseEscrowedMoca(uint256 amount)`**
- Instant 1:1 conversion for asset managers
- Burns caller's esMoca and transfers native Moca (or wMoca if native transfer fails within gas limit)
- No penalties applied

### For EscrowedMoca Admin

**`setRedemptionOption(uint256 redemptionOption, uint128 lockDuration, uint128 receivablePct)`**
- Creates or updates a redemption option
- Sets lock duration (0 for instant) and receivable percentage
- Automatically enables the option

**`setRedemptionOptionStatus(uint256 redemptionOption, bool enable)`**
- Enables or disables an existing redemption option
- Allows temporary disabling without deleting configuration

**`setVotersPenaltyPct(uint256 votersPenaltyPct)`**
- Updates the percentage of penalties allocated to voters
- Can be set to 0 (all penalties go to treasury)
- Range: 0 to 10,000 (2 decimal precision)

**`setWhitelistStatus(address addr, bool isWhitelisted)`**
- Adds or removes addresses from the transfer whitelist
- Only whitelisted addresses can transfer esMoca

**`setMocaTransferGasLimit(uint256 newMocaTransferGasLimit)`**
- Updates the gas limit for native Moca transfers
- Minimum: 2300 (required for EOA transfers)
- Typical values: 2300 for EOA, 4029 for Gnosis Safe with fallback

## Access Control & Roles

The system uses role-based access control via the AccessController:

| **Role**                  | **Permissions**                                        | **Purpose**                        |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **User**                  | escrowMoca, selectRedemptionOption, claimRedemptions   | Standard user operations           |
| **CronJob**               | escrowMocaOnBehalf                                     | Periodic rewards distribution      |
| **Asset Manager**         | claimPenalties, releaseEscrowedMoca                    | Protocol operations                |
| **EscrowedMoca Admin**    | setRedemptionOption, setRedemptionOptionStatus, setVotersPenaltyPct, setWhitelistStatus, setMocaTransferGasLimit | Parameter configuration            |
| **Monitor**               | pause                                                  | Emergency response (automated)     |
| **Global Admin**          | unpause, freeze                                        | Emergency response (multisig)      |
| **Emergency Exit Handler**| emergencyExit, emergencyExitPenalties                  | Asset recovery when frozen         |

## Transfer Restrictions

esMoca is **non-transferable** by default. This ensures:
- Rewards stay with intended recipients
- No secondary markets for esMoca

**Exception: Whitelist System**
- Specific addresses can be whitelisted to transfer esMoca
- Primary use case: Asset Manager transferring to VotingController to deposit rewards/subsidies
- Only the **sender** must be whitelisted (recipient does not need to be whitelisted)

## Risk Management

### Three-Tier Safety System

1. **Pausable** 
   - Monitor role can pause (automated response)
   - Global Admin can unpause (manual review)
   - Blocks all user operations when paused

2. **Freeze Mechanism**
   - One-way kill switch (cannot be unfrozen)
   - Requires contract to be paused first
   - Enables emergency exit functionality

3. **Emergency Exit**
   - Only available when frozen
   - `emergencyExit()`: Users or Emergency Exit Handler can transfer all esMoca balance + pending redemptions to users
   - `emergencyExitPenalties()`: Emergency Exit Handler can transfer all accrued penalties to esMoca treasury

### Risk Hierarchy
```
Normal Operation → Monitor Pauses → Global Admin Reviews
                                            ↓
                                   [Unpause or Freeze]
                                            ↓
                                  [If Frozen: Emergency Exit]
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Precision and Limits

- **Percentage Precision**: 2 decimal places (10,000 = 100%, 100 = 1%, 1 = 0.01%)
- **Maximum Lock Duration**: 888 days (~2.4 years)
- **Redemption Options**: Unlimited number, each independently configurable *[via mapping]*

### State Tracking

The contract maintains several key state variables:
- `TOTAL_MOCA_PENDING_REDEMPTION`: Total MOCA locked in scheduled redemptions awaiting claim
- `ACCRUED_PENALTY_TO_VOTERS/TREASURY`: Accumulated penalties (in native Moca)
- `CLAIMED_PENALTY_FROM_VOTERS/TREASURY`: Already distributed penalties
- `MOCA_TRANSFER_GAS_LIMIT`: Gas limit for native Moca transfers (minimum 2300, configurable)
- `wMoca`: Address of wrapped Moca contract (used as fallback if native transfer fails)

### Redemption Storage Pattern

```solidity
mapping(address user => mapping(uint256 timestamp => Redemption)) redemptionSchedule;

struct Redemption {
    uint256 mocaReceivable;  // Moca to receive
    uint256 penalty;         // Penalty amount
    uint256 claimed;         // Already claimed amount
}
```

Multiple redemptions can be scheduled for the same timestamp, and they aggregate automatically.

### Native Moca Transfer & Wrapping Mechanism

The contract uses native Moca for all transfers but includes a safety mechanism:
- All Moca transfers attempt native transfer first (using `.call{value: amount}(gasLimit)`)
- If the native transfer fails within the `MOCA_TRANSFER_GAS_LIMIT`, the contract automatically wraps Moca to wMoca and transfers wMoca instead
- This ensures compatibility with contracts that don't accept native Moca (e.g., some contracts require explicit receive/fallback functions with sufficient gas)
- Gas limit is configurable by EscrowedMocaAdmin (minimum 2300, typical values: ~2300 for EOA, ~4029 for Gnosis Safe)

## Integration Points

### With VotingController
- Asset Manager can transfer esMoca as voting rewards
- Requires whitelist configuration
- Enables reward distribution in esMoca instead of Moca

### With VotingEscrowMoca
- Users can lock esMoca (instead of Moca) to create veMoca positions
- Provides flexibility in how users engage with the voting system

## Design Rationale

### Why Non-Transferable?

Making esMoca non-transferable prevents:
- Circumvention of vesting schedules through secondary markets
- Complex tracking of redemption rights across addresses

### Why Multiple Redemption Options?

Different users have different liquidity needs:
- **Long-term holders**: Maximum value through patient redemption
- **Liquidity seekers**: Immediate access at a cost
- **Balanced users**: Middle-ground options

### Why Split Penalties?

Penalties serve dual purposes:
1. **Compensate voters**: Those who lock longer benefit from others' impatience
2. **Fund treasury**: Protocol treasury for self-sustainability

The configurable split allows governance to balance these objectives.

## Security Considerations

1. **Reentrancy Protection**: Native Moca transfers use gas-limited calls with automatic wrapping fallback
2. **Integer Overflow**: Redemption calculations protected by Solidity 0.8.x checks
3. **Access Control**: All privileged functions have explicit role checks
4. **State Consistency**: Burn happens before external calls in redemption flow
5. **Precision Loss**: Explicit checks prevent zero-penalty redemptions with positive receivables (prevents rounding abuse)
6. **Native Transfer Safety**: Automatic wrapping to wMoca if native transfer fails, ensuring transfers always succeed
7. **Gas Limit Configuration**: Configurable gas limits for native transfers prevent DoS from gas-guzzling fallback functions

# Coverage

1. Note that require statements are reflected as "yellow", although tests for them exists (but clear should they be converted to if conditions). Likely bug.
2. Coverage was ran focussing on EscrowedMoca.sol and its tests, the other contracts should be ignored as their test files were discarded when running coverage.
