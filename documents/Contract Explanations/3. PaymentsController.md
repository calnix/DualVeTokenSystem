# PaymentsController Overview

PaymentsController.sol manages payment flows for credential verification, handling crediting and debiting verifiers and issuers accordingly. 
- includes an expense accounting system to allocate subsidies for verifiers who stake MOCA tokens
- issuers' gross verification fees subject to a haircut, which goes to the protocol, and voters [VotingController]. 

PaymentsController is architected for high-throughput, low-latency operations, with a focus on minimizing gas costs in core transaction flows. 
- Gas optimization is prioritized in `deductBalance` and `deductBalanceZeroFee`, as these functions are invoked at scale—potentially millions of times.
- The contract leverages hybrid memory-storage access patterns and selective updates to ensure efficiency under sustained, high-frequency usage.

## Key Features

### 1. **Hybrid Storage-Memory Optimization for High-Frequency Functions**
- `deductBalance()`, called on every credential verification, employs a dual-reference pattern that reduces gas consumption by ~40%.
- Reads are performed from memory (3 gas) while writes use storage pointers (100 gas), optimizing for the common case of multiple reads per write.

This pattern is critical for a function that may be called millions of times daily.

### 2. **Three-Actor Economic Model**
- `Verifiers`: Pay for credential verifications, can stake MOCA for subsidies
- `Issuers`: Create credential schemas and earn fees from verifications
- `Voters`: Receive a cut of verification fees for participating in governance
- `Protocol`: Receives a cut of verification fees for treasury

### 3. **Dynamic Fee System with Time-Delayed Increases**
- Fee decreases apply immediately to benefit users
- Fee increases are delayed by a configurable period (min: 1 epoch) to prevent sudden price hikes

This protects verifiers from unexpected cost increases while allowing issuers flexibility in pricing.

### 4. **Staking-Based Subsidy Tiers**
- Verifiers have to stake exact MOCA amounts to unlock subsidy percentages
- Subsidies are calculated on gross fees and tracked per epoch for distribution 
- Subsidies are collected as USD8, as are fees. 

Subsidies are distributed via `VotingController` contract on an epoch basis; in the form of `esMoca`.
*Note: Subsidies are accrued in USD8 within PaymentsController, converted to esMOCA off-chain, then distributed via VotingController.*

### 5. **Zero-Fee Credential Support**

The `deductBalanceZeroFee` function is dedicated to handling free credential verifications. 
- Removes unnecessary fee logic and signature parameters for zero-fee flows 
- Streamlines execution and reduces gas costs for free credential use cases 
- Simplifies logic for scenarios where is free

This significantly helps reduce the gas footprint of `deductBalance` allowing for more throughput as well, while accommodating for a low-probability scenario for feature completeness.

### 6. **Integration with Voting Pools**

Schemas can be linked to voting pools to facilitate voter rewards. 
- Pool associations are updatable mid-epoch, with explicit rules governing subsidy eligibility 
- Supports dynamic governance participation incentives and flexible reward distribution

### 7. **Emergency Risk Management**

- Implements multi-tiered access control with specialized roles 
- Provides pause/unpause functionality for operational contingencies 
- Features a one-way freeze kill-switch and emergency exit procedures 
- Ensures user funds remain recoverable under all circumstances

# 1. **Contract Overview**

## Financial Tracking
```solidity
// Subsidy tracking for VotingController integration
mapping(uint256 epoch => mapping(bytes32 poolId => uint256 totalSubsidies)) _epochPoolSubsidies;
mapping(uint256 epoch => mapping(bytes32 poolId => mapping(bytes32 verifierId => uint256))) _epochPoolVerifierSubsidies;

// Fee tracking for rewards distribution
mapping(uint256 epoch => mapping(bytes32 poolId => DataTypes.FeesAccrued)) _epochPoolFeesAccrued;
mapping(uint256 epoch => DataTypes.FeesAccrued) _epochFeesAccrued;
```

**These mappings enable:**
- Precise tracking of subsidies per verifier per pool per epoch
- Accurate fee distribution to protocol and voters
- Epoch-based accounting for clean financial reconciliation

## Actor Data

```solidity
// Primary actor mappings
mapping(bytes32 issuerId => DataTypes.Issuer) internal _issuers;
mapping(bytes32 verifierId => DataTypes.Verifier) internal _verifiers;
mapping(bytes32 schemaId => DataTypes.Schema) internal _schemas;
```

## Actor Workflows

### Issuer Onboarding

1. Create Profile: Call `createIssuer(assetAddress)` to receive unique `issuerId`
2. Create Schemas: Call `createSchema(issuerId, fee)` for each credential type
3. Manage Fees: Update schema fees as needed (decreases immediate, increases delayed)
4. Claim Revenue: Periodically claim accumulated fees to asset address

#### Issuer Structure

`function createIssuer(address assetAddress) external returns (bytes32)`
- returns `issuerId`, for integration with middleware translation layer.

The following struct defines the on-chain attributes of an issuer:

```solidity
    struct Issuer {
        bytes32 issuerId;
        address adminAddress;       // for interacting w/ contract 
        address assetAddress;       // for claiming fees 
                
        // credentials
        uint128 totalVerified; // incremented on each verification
        
        // USD8 | 6dp precision
        uint128 totalNetFeesAccrued;    // net of protocol and voter fees
        uint128 totalClaimed;

        uint128 totalSchemas;       // track schemas created by issuer
    }
```

- `issuerId`: Deterministically generated `bytes32` identifier assigned at issuer creation: `bytes32 issuerId = keccak256(abi.encode("ISSUER", msg.sender));`
- `adminAddress`: Set to `msg.sender` at creation; serves as the issuer's control address for contract interactions (e.g., schema management, fee updates, address changes).
- `assetAddress`: Provided at creation; acts as the designated wallet for claiming accrued fees.

The `assetAddress` is dedicated solely to fee withdrawals, while the `adminAddress` is required for all issuer-initiated contract actions. 
This separation enables issuers to maintain distinct operational and treasury controls, supporting flexible security postures.

The `adminAddress` is immutable, and cannot be changed by an issuer. 
- If their admin address is compromised, they will have to create a new issuer profile with a new admin address (new issuerId).
- Fees unclaimed under their previous issuer profile, would be lost, assuming the attacked immediately called `updateAssetAddress` and `claimFees`, the moment the admin address was exploited.

**Rationale for assigning issuers an on-chain id:**
- Enables updates of asset addresses without recreating or migrating profiles.
- Facilitates granular access control, allowing issuers to assign different addresses for configuration and asset management
- Allows address rotation without profile migration

*Without an on-chain issuer ID, issuers would be forced to use a **single address** for all actions, limiting flexibility and upgradability.*

### Verifier Onboarding

1. Create Profile: Call `createVerifier(signerAddress, assetAddress)` to receive unique `verifierId`
2. Deposit Funds: Transfer USD8 via `deposit()` to fund verifications
3. Operate: Sign verification requests that deduct from balance
4. Optional Staking: Stake exact Moca amounts to unlock subsidy tiers

#### Verifier Structure

`function createVerifier(address signerAddress, address assetAddress) external returns (bytes32)`
- returns `verifierId`, for integration with middleware translation layer

The following struct defines the on-chain attributes of a verifier:

```solidity
    struct Verifier {
        bytes32 verifierId;
        address adminAddress;   // msg.sender
        address assetAddress;   // used for both deposit/withdrawing fees + staking Moca
        address signerAddress;

        // MOCA | 18 dp precision
        uint128 mocaStaked;

        // USD8 | 6dp precision
        uint128 currentBalance;
        uint128 totalExpenditure;  // count: never decremented
    }
```
- `verifierId`: Deterministically generated `bytes32` identifier assigned at issuer creation: `bytes32 verifierId = keccak256(abi.encode("VERIFIER", msg.sender));`
- `adminAddress`: Assigned at verifier creation (`msg.sender`); controls verifier configuration, key rotation, and operational actions.
- `signerAddress`: Used exclusively for EIP-712 signature validation on verification payments; can be updated independently for key rotation.
- `assetAddress`: Dedicated for deposit/withdrawal of USD8 balances and staking MOCA; enables separation of treasury and operational controls.

Verifiers are assigned distinct `admin`, `signer`, and `asset` addresses, enabling independent management of operational permissions, signature authority, and treasury controls. 
This modular approach supports secure key rotation and flexible access strategies.

The `adminAddress` is immutable, and cannot be changed by an issuer. 
- If their admin address is compromised, they will have to create a new profile with a new admin address (new verifierId).
- USD8 balances and Moca staked under theIr previous profile, would be lost; assuming the attacked immediately called `updateAssetAddress` follow by `withdraw` and `unstakeMoca` , the moment the admin address was exploited.

**Rationale for On-Chain Verifier ID:**
- Independent admin, asset, and signer address management for robust key rotation
- Enables updating of signer and asset addresses without recreating or migrating profiles.
- Supports separation of signature and asset management roles for enhanced security
- Facilitates granular access control and adaptable organizational wallet structures

*Without an on-chain verifier ID, verifiers would be forced to use a **single address** for all actions, limiting flexibility and upgradability. This design ensures they can adapt their address management as their operational requirements evolve.*

### Schemas: The Credential Blueprint

A schema defines the structure and rules for a credential type. Think of it as a blueprint that specifies:

**Off-chain components (not stored in contract):**
- Public metadata: title, data source type, version, header information
- Technical specifications: zk-proof requirements, encryption parameters
- Private validation rules: allowed claims, data types, constraints

**On-chain components (stored in PaymentsController):**
- Financial parameters: current fee, pending fee updates
- Usage metrics: verification counts, fees accumulated
- Governance links: optional voting pool association

#### Creating Schemas

`function createSchema(bytes32 issuerId, uint128 fee) external returns (bytes32)`

When an issuer calls `createSchema`, the contract:
1. Generates a unique `bytes32` schemaId
2. Links it to the issuer
3. Sets the initial verification fee
4. Initializes counters for tracking usage

#### Schema Structure

```solidity
    struct Schema {
        bytes32 schemaId;
        bytes32 issuerId;
        
        // fees are expressed in USD8 terms | 6dp precision
        uint128 currentFee;
        uint128 nextFee;
        uint128 nextFeeTimestamp;       

        // counts: never decremented
        uint128 totalVerified;
        uint128 totalGrossFeesAccrued;            // disregards protocol and voting fees

        // for VotingController
        bytes32 poolId;
    }
```

`schemaId` is generated like so: 

```solidity
        // Generate deterministic schemaId based on msg.sender and count
        uint256 totalSchemas = _issuers[issuerId].totalSchemas;
        bytes32 schemaId = keccak256(abi.encode("SCHEMA", issuerId, totalSchemas));
```

#### On-chain vs Off-chain Design

The PaymentsController only stores schema financial data, not credential logic.
- **On-chain**: Fees, metrics, pool associations
- **Off-chain**: Credential logic, validation rules, metadata
- **Middleware**: Maps schemaIds to off-chain definitions

>Benefits: Gas efficiency, evolution without upgrades, and logic confidentiality.

#### Schema Fee Management

Issuers can update schema fees with built-in protections:
- **Decreases**: Apply immediately to benefit verifiers
- **Increases**: Subject to delay (minimum 1 epoch) to prevent price shocks

#### Voting Pool Integration

Schemas can be associated with voting pools to enable voter rewards:

```solidity
updatePoolId(bytes32 schemaId, bytes32 poolId)  // Admin function
```

**Pool Association Rules:**
- Default: `poolId = bytes32(0)` (no voting pool)
- Can be updated mid-epoch with clear subsidy implications
- Pools are created in VotingController, referenced here

**Important Timing Considerations:**
- **Adding mid-epoch**: Prior verifications in that epoch won't qualify for subsidies
- **Removing mid-epoch**: Weight excluded from pool calculations; prior verifications forfeit subsidies
- **Best practice**: Update pool associations at epoch boundaries when possible

This design enables dynamic governance participation while maintaining clear rules about subsidy eligibility.

# 2. **Design Choices**

## The deductBalance Pattern 

The `deductBalance` function is the most frequently called function in the PaymentsController, executed on every credential verification. 
- in a high-throughput environment, even small gas inefficiencies compound into significant costs.
- hence, we have implemented a hybrid storage-memory optimization pattern that reduces gas consumption by approximately 40%.

**Traditional Approach Problem:**
- Pure storage reads: Each field access costs ~100 gas
- Schema has 8-10 fields accessed per verification
- Total cost: 800-1000 gas just for reads

**The Hybrid Approach**
We employ a dual-reference pattern that optimizes for both read and write operations:

```solidity
// Storage pointer for write operations
DataTypes.Schema storage schemaStorage = _schemas[schemaId];

// Memory copy for read operations  
DataTypes.Schema memory schema = schemaStorage;
```

**This pattern allows us to:**

1. Read efficiently: Access struct fields from memory (3 gas) instead of storage (100 gas)
2. Write selectively: Update storage only when necessary using the storage pointer
3. Maintain consistency: Keep a clear separation between read and write operations

### Design Rationale

**Why Hybrid Instead of Pure Memory?**
- Conditional Updates: Fee updates only occur when conditions are met
- Atomic Operations: Storage updates must be atomic for consistency
- Memory Limitations: Full memory copy would be wasteful for conditional writes

**Why Not Pure Storage?**
- Read Frequency: Schema fields are read 8-10 times per execution
- Calculation Needs: Multiple fields needed for fee calculations
- Cost Multiplication: Each storage read adds 100 gas

### Gas Savings Breakdown

| **Optimization Technique**| **Gas Saved**  | **Impact**                              |
|---------------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Schema memory caching     | ~800 gas       | Eliminates 8 storage reads              |
| Verifier data caching     | ~200 gas       | Eliminates 2 storage reads              |
| Batch storage updates     | ~100 gas       | Reduces storage operation overhead      |
| Unchecked arithmetic      | ~80 gas        | Safe counters don't need overflow checks|
| **Total Savings**         | **~1,180 gas** | **~40% reduction**                      |


### Zero-Fee Credentials: Separate Function

`deductBalanceZeroFee` exists as a distinct function to handle zero-fee verification transactions.

***TLDR:*** 
- Adding zero-fee branching to `deductBalance` would increase gas costs for all standard (fee-bearing) verifications; the common case.
- Separation is intentional, as we do not expect zero-fee verifications be to be common.
- Additionally, prevents accidental fee deductions through explicit intent

## Subsidy System: Exact Staking Amounts

Verifiers must stake exact MOCA amounts (e.g., exactly 1000 MOCA for 10% subsidy), not ranges.

```solidity
mapping(uint256 mocaStaked => uint256 subsidyPercentage) _verifiersSubsidyPercentages;
```

- Predictability: Clear tiers without ambiguity
- Simplicity: Single mapping lookup, no range checking
- Anti-Gaming: Can't stake 999.99 to get benefits of 1000
- Flexibility: Admin can add/modify tiers without complex logic

# 3. **Contract Functions Walkthrough**

## `deductBalance()`

The `deductBalance()` function coordinates all payment and accounting steps for each credential verification.
It is the heart of the system.

1. **Signature Validation**
- Validates EIP-712 signature from the verifier’s authorized signer.
- Increments a nonce to prevent replay attacks.
- Confirms the verifier’s explicit approval for the transaction.

2. **Fee Management**
- Checks for any pending schema fee increases and applies them if the delay period has elapsed.
- Updates the current fee accordingly.
- Emits events to record fee changes.

3. **Balance Deduction & Distribution**
- Confirms the verifier has sufficient balance.
- Calculates protocol and voting fee portions.
- Atomically updates all relevant balances (verifier, issuer, protocol, voters).

4. **Subsidy Booking (Conditional)**
- Checks if verifier has staked, and is subject to which subsidy tier.
- Calculates subsidy based on gross fee, if eligible.
- Books subsidy for distribution at epoch end. [via `VotingController`]

5. **Global Accounting & Audit Trail**
- Increments verification counters for schema and issuer.
- Updates fee and subsidy records for each pool and epoch.
- Emits events to maintain a comprehensive audit trail.

---

### Fee Distribution Model

For each verification fee paid:
- **Issuer receives:** `Fee - Protocol Fee - Voting Fee`
- **Protocol receives:** `Fee × Protocol Fee Percentage`
- **Voters receive:** `Fee × Voting Fee Percentage`
- **Verifier may receive:** Subsidy based on staking tier (if eligible)

## Administrative Functions

### Fee Management

1. **`updateSchemaFee`:** Issuers can adjust schema fees with protection against sudden increases
2. **`updateProtocolFeePercentage:`** Protocol can adjust its fee share
3. **`updateVotingFeePercentage`:** Adjust voter reward percentage 
  
### Pool Integration

**`updatePoolId`:** Associate schemas with voting pools
- Enables voter rewards for specific credential types
- Can be updated mid-epoch with clear subsidy rules

---

# 4. **Execution Flows**

## Typical Verification Flow
1. Verifier requests credential verification from user [`Initiated by user`]
2. Verifier signs EIP-712 message authorizing payment
3. Universal Verifier Contract calls PaymentsController.deductBalance()
4. PaymentsController:
    - Validates signature and amount
    - Deducts from verifier balance
    - Distributes fees to issuer/protocol/voters
    - Books subsidies if applicable
5. Verification proceeds with payment confirmed

## Issuer: claiming fees 
- Accumulated fees become claimable
- No epoch-based restrictions on claims
- Single transaction to claim all unclaimed fees

### Protocol: withdraw protocolFees & withdraw VotersFees
- Both fees withdrawable after epoch ends
- Clean separation of fee types for transparency

*However, protocol is allowed discretion when depositing into `VotingController`, hence `VotingController` does not integrate with `PaymentsController` to drive subsidy/reward claims.*

---

# 5. **Integration Points**

## With Universal Verifier Contract
- Primary caller of `deductBalance` and `deductBalanceZeroFee`
- Should reference `PaymentsController` through `AddressBook` for upgradeability

## With VotingController
- `PaymentsController` tracks subsidy & rewards accruals
- `VotingController` handles subsidy & rewards distribution
- Clean separation prevents circular dependencies
- Enables independent contract upgrades

## With AddressBook
- Central registry for contract addresses
- Enables seamless contract upgrades
- `PaymentsController` reads token addresses dynamically

---

# 6. **Timing and Epoch Considerations**

## Epoch Framework

PaymentsController operates on an epoch-based timeline that synchronizes with VotingController:
- **Epoch Duration**: Defined in EpochMath library (`14 days`)
- **Current Epoch**: Determined by `EpochMath.getCurrentEpochNumber()`
- **Epoch Boundaries**: Critical for subsidy calculations and fee withdrawals

## Time-Dependent Operations

### 1. Fee Increase Delays

**Minimum Delay**: 1 epoch (configurable via `FEE_INCREASE_DELAY_PERIOD`)

**Timeline Example:**
- Epoch N, Day 2: Issuer requests fee increase from 100 → 150 USD8
- System sets: nextFee = 150, nextFeeTimestamp = currentTime + DELAY
- Epoch N+1, Day 2: Fee automatically updates to 150 USD8
- All verifications from this point use new fee

**Key Points**:
- Delay must be in epoch intervals 
- Fee decreases bypass delay (immediate effect)
- Pending increases can be overridden by new updates

### 2. Pool Association Timing

Schemas can be associated with voting pools at any time, but timing affects subsidy eligibility:

**2.1: Adding Pool Association Mid-Epoch**:

Epoch N Timeline:
├─ Day 1-3: Schema has no pool (`poolId = 0`)
│ → Verifications accrue NO subsidies
├─ Day 4: Admin calls updatePoolId(schemaId, poolId)
│ → Association active
└─ Day 4-7: New verifications accrue subsidies

*Day 1-3 verifications are ineligible for subsidies.*

**2.2: Removing Pool Association Mid-Epoch**:

Epoch N Timeline:
├─ Day 1-3: Schema associated with poolId
│ → Verifications accrue subsidies
├─ Day 4: Admin sets poolId = 0
│ → Association removed
└─ Day 4-7: New verifications accrue NO subsidies

*Only day 1-3 subsidies are claimable.*
*Day 4-7 subsidies are FORFEITED.*


**Best Practice**: Update pool associations at epoch boundaries to avoid confusion.

### 3. Subsidy Distribution Timeline

Subsidies follow a multi-step process across epochs:

# 7. **Risk Management**

## Access Control Hierarchy

### Operational Roles
- **Payments Admin**: Configure fees, pools, and tiers
- **Asset Manager**: Withdraw protocol/voter fees
- **Monitor**: Pause contract in emergencies
- **Global Admin**: Unpause and freeze operations
- **Emergency Exit Handler**: Recover funds when frozen

### Security Features

1. **Pausable Operations**
   - All state-changing functions check pause status
   - Monitor can pause, only Global Admin can unpause
   - Prevents damage during active incidents

2. **Freeze Mechanism**
   - One-way operation requiring contract to be paused first
   - Enables emergency exit procedures
   - Cannot be reversed - kill-switch

3. **Emergency Exit**
   - Batch processing of verifier/issuer withdrawals
   - Only accessible when contract is frozen
   - Ensures users can always recover funds
   - Only callable by EmergencyExitHandler role

---

# 8. **Upgrade Architecture**

## Upgrade Process

1. **Deploy** new PaymentsController version
2. **Configure** new contract with existing actor data (optional migration functions)
3. **Update** AddressBook to point to new contract
4. **Notify** verifiers to migrate USD8 balances
5. **Freeze** old contract once migration complete

## Design for Upgradeability

- No direct contract-to-contract calls (except through AddressBook)
- Clean interfaces for external integrations
- Financial data is segmented by epoch to enable straightforward migration and transition
- Emergency exit ensures no funds locked during transition

---

# **Appendix: Technical Deep Dives**

## Gas Optimization Detailed Analysis

### Storage Access Patterns [`deductBalance()`]
```solidity
// Expensive: Multiple storage reads
uint128 fee = _schemas[schemaId].currentFee;        // 100 gas
uint128 nextFee = _schemas[schemaId].nextFee;       // 100 gas  
uint128 totalVerified = _schemas[schemaId].totalVerified; // 100 gas

// Optimized: Single storage read, multiple memory reads
DataTypes.Schema memory schema = _schemas[schemaId]; // 100 gas once
uint128 fee = schema.currentFee;                     // 3 gas
uint128 nextFee = schema.nextFee;                    // 3 gas
uint128 totalVerified = schema.totalVerified;        // 3 gas
```

### Unchecked Arithmetic
Safe to use `unchecked` blocks for:
- Counter increments (won't overflow in contract lifetime)
- Fee calculations (percentages ensure result < input)
- Balance deductions (already checked for sufficiency)

## Precision and Rounding

### Token Decimals
- **USD8**: 6 decimals (1 USD8 = 1,000,000 units)
- **MOCA**: 18 decimals (1 MOCA = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 units)
- **esMOCA**: 18 decimals (same as MOCA)

### Fee Calculation Precision
- Percentages are in expressed in 2 decimal precision (XX.yy)
- range:[1–10_000] (100%: 10_000, 1%: 100, 0.1%: 10, 0.01%: 1)
- All fee calculations round down (favor issuers over protocol)

## Emergency Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Critical Bug Discovery
1. Monitor calls `pause()` - stops all operations
2. Team investigates and determines fix timeline
3. If fixable: Deploy fix, `unpause()` when safe
4. If critical: `freeze()` and initiate emergency exit

### Scenario 2: Malicious Issuer
1. Cannot steal funds (only claim their earned fees)
2. Can manipulate schema fees (but with delay protection)
3. Verifiers protected by signature requirements
4. Worst case: Verifiers stop using malicious schemas

### Scenario 3: Contract Upgrade Failure  
1. Old contract continues operating normally
2. If new contract has issues: revert AddressBook update
3. If migration fails: emergency exit from new problematic contract
4. Users funds always recoverable through emergency procedures
