# 2. Credential Pools and Voting [veMOCA]

- Credential pools will be created on-chain
- Each credential pool is representative of a unique type of schema. E.g. Credit Score, Age, Proof of Residence

- Issuers are data providers of one or more schemes. E.g. Credit Bureau for credit scores.
- We refer to the data provided as a credential.
- Verifiers are applications looking to verify specific data points, credentials of a user to determine entry or some outcome.

- veMOCA holders can vote on pools
- Voting determines how much 



This section describes how MOCA can be staked to receive veMOCA:

- veMOCA is used to vote on credential pools
- Votes influence the amount of emissions a credential pool receives for an epoch.
- Subsidies are distributed as esMOCA
- Voters receive verification fee rewards for their participation in voting.

## Staking MOCA for veMOCA

- Stake MOCA tokens to receive veMOCA (voting power)
- Longer lock periods result in higher veMOCA allocation
- veMOCA decays linearly over time, reducing voting power
- Formula-based calculation determines veMOCA amount based on stake amount and duration

### veMoca receivable formula

Lock duration: {min: 7 Days,  max: 2 years}

Formula

```bash
veMOCA = MOCA_staked * (lockTimeInSeconds / MAX_LOCK_TIME_IN_SECONDS)
```

Example: Lock 100 MOCA for 6 months: 100 MOCA * (6 months / 2 years) = 25 veMOCA

### Decay: decay linearly every second

- lock for 2 years: your veMOCA starts at full power and gradually reduces to 0 over 2 years.
- If you **extend the lock**, you maintain your veMOCA.
- smlj extend your lock - what happens to veMOCA?

## Voting with veMOCA

- 28-day voting epochs
- Users can split their votes across multiple credential pools
- Users that vote, get rewards. Those that do not vote, do not get rewards.
- End-of-epoch snapshot determines veMOCA voting power distribution

### Vote Delegation

- Users can delegate veMOCA to others, who can vote on their behalf
- Open system allowing anyone to become a Delegate Leader
- Leaders earn commission (e.g. 10%) on verification fees from voted pools
- Flexible delegation allowing allocation to any available Leader

## Subsidies and esMOCA

At the end of a voting period, $esMOCA emissions will be allocated to different credential pools, as per the votes.
Verifiers will pay for verifications in full, and consequently receive $esMOCA as “cashback” from these credential pools.

- Subsidies allocated to credential pools based on voting results
- Verifiers receive verification subsidies as esMOCA

*so each pool must hold an esMOCA balance?*
*distribute based on ecdsa signatures?*

### Allocation of $esMOCA Subsidy Emissions

- Verifiers receive X% of verification fees as $esMOCA cashback from schema-specific subsidy pools
- If Verifier paid 10 $MOCA for verification, (assuming 50% subsidy) they receive 5 $esMOCA.
- Unused subsidies return to treasury at epoch end

## Credential Pool Setup

- Issuers must be whitelisted by the protocol administrators
- Multiple issuers can be authorized to issue credentials for the same schema
- Verifiers must specify (in advance) which issuer's credentials they will accept for verification

## Others

**Can validators participate in voting?**

- Yes; but only through their esMOCA
- $esMOCA emissions can be staked for $veMOCA (it is treated 1:1 as $MOCA when staking)

## Credential Pool (aka Schema)

**Example of a credential pool/scheme:**

- Proof of Personhood Schema
- Credit Score
- Proof of Income

**Credential**

- instance of data issued to a user conforming to a credential schema
- a user's proof of income is a credential
