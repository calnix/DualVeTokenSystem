# 2. AIT KIT and Verification payments

## Background

The network facilitates credential verification through a marketplace connecting issuers (data providers) and verifiers (applications). Issuers provide credentials based on schemas (e.g., credit scores), while verifiers use these credentials to verify user data for specific outcomes (e.g., age verification for lending). Verifiers compensate issuers for this service.

- Credential Schema: Standardized template for verifying credentials (e.g., credit scores, age verification, income proof)
- Issuers: data providers of one or more schemes. E.g. Credit Bureau for credit scores
- Verifiers: applications looking to verify specific data points, credentials of a user to determine entry or some outcome

**Whitelisting actors**

- Issuers will be onboarded and whitelisted by us
- There can be multiple whitelisted issuers for the same schema
- Verifiers must specify (in advance) which issuer's credentials they will accept for verification of a specific schema

Verification fees are split across the different network stakeholders.

## Verification Fee distribution

Verification fees primarily goes to the Issuers [since they supply data].

**Fee distribution amongst different stakeholders**

- Voters   -> 20%
- Treasury -> 10%
- Issuers  -> 70%
- Referrers -> ?

Issuers can divert a portion of fees to referrers. This is optional commission.
I.e. issuers can divert 10% to referrers and take-home 60%.

veMOCA voters earn a small portion of verification fees from schemas they voted on. This is to facilitate voting activity.
Voting will be explaining in the next section.

*Unclear*

```smlj
how do issuers allocate to referrers?

1. on a per address basis?
2. define a global portion which gets equally split across all referrers?
```



When a verifier pays a verification fee, it is distributed among three parties: issuers, voters, and the treasury. The distribution mechanism for voters needs clarification since they vote on credential pools rather than individual issuers.

For a given credential schema, multiple issuers may exist within the same pool. The question arises: should the voter's portion of verification fees be aggregated across all issuers within a schema and then distributed proportionally to voters who supported that credential pool?
