        When you call EpochMath.getCurrentEpochNumber() directly in a test, these internal functions get inlined into the test contract at compile time. 
        This can cause issues with Foundry's runtime state modifications like vm.warp().
        The issue is that the Solidity optimizer might be evaluating block.timestamp at a different point than expected, 
        or caching values in unexpected ways when dealing with inlined library code.
        So we need to use a dummy variable to prevent the compiler from inlining the functions.
